#### Dataset chosen for the project: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mariotormo/complete-pokemon-dataset-updated-090420/code

### Exploratory Data Analysis
#### Question 1: What is the distribution of Pokemon Primary Types in the dataset?
#### Question 2: Is there a relationship between a Pokemon's Legendary status and its stats?
#### Question 3: How does the distribution of base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed) differ across generations?
#### Question 4: Is there a relationship between a Pokemon's generation and its stats?



### Research Question: Can we predict a Pok√©mon's generation based on its stats?
- This research question extends the EDA's questions exploration into predictive modeling. We will be taking the exploration into stats and generations further by attempting predictions based on observed patterns within these variables.
